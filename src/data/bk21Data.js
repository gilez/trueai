            content: `Greetings, I am Daehun Nyang, Director of the 'Trustworthy and Resource-Efficient AI Research & Education Group (TRUE-AI)' at Ewha Womans University.

Artificial intelligence technology is driving innovation across society, including healthcare, finance, defense, and education. However, challenges such as the rapid computational resource consumption of large-scale AI models and reliability issues like cyber attacks and privacy breaches must be addressed for sustainable AI development.

Our research group responds to these contemporary needs by researching and educating next-generation core AI technologies centered on 'Resource-Efficiency' and 'Trustworthiness'.

Together with our excellent faculty from Computer Science, Cybersecurity, and AI Convergence programs, we will cultivate convergent talent who not only develop AI but also fulfill social responsibilities and overcome technical limitations.

Thank you.`
